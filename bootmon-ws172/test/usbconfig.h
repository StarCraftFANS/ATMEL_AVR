General Description:
This file contains the configuration options for the USB driver.

Please note that the usbdrv contains a usbconfig-prototype.h file now. We
recommend that you use that file as a template because it will always list
the newest features and options.

/* ------------------- Fine Control over USB Descriptors ------------------- */
/* If you don't want to use the driver's default USB descriptors, you can
 * provide our own. These can be provided as (1) fixed length static data in
 * flash memory, (2) fixed length static data in RAM or (3) dynamically at
 * runtime in the function usbFunctionDescriptor(). See usbdrv.h for more
 * information about this function.
 * Descriptor handling is configured through the descriptor's properties. If
 * no properties are defined or if they are 0, the default descriptor is used.
 * Possible properties are:
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_DYNAMIC: The data for the descriptor should be fetched
 *     at runtime via usbFunctionDescriptor().
 *   + USB_PROP_IS_RAM: The data returned by usbFunctionDescriptor() or found
 *     in static memory is in RAM, not in flash memory.
 *   + USB_PROP_LENGTH(len): If the data is in static memory (RAM or flash),
 *     the driver must know the descriptor's length. The descriptor itself is
 *     found at the address of a well known identifier (see below).
 * List of static descriptor names (must be declared PROGMEM if in flash):
 *   char usbDescriptorDevice[];
 *   char usbDescriptorConfiguration[];
 *   char usbDescriptorHidReport[];
 *   char usbDescriptorString0[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringVendor[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringDevice[];
 *   int usbDescriptorStringSerialNumber[];
 * Other descriptors can't be provided statically, they must be provided
 * dynamically at runtime.
 *
 * Descriptor properties are or-ed or added together, e.g.:
 * #define USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE   (USB_PROP_IS_RAM | USB_PROP_LENGTH(18))
 *
 * The following descriptors are defined:
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_DEVICE
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_CONFIGURATION
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRINGS
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_0
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_VENDOR
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_PRODUCT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_STRING_SERIAL_NUMBER
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_HID_REPORT
 *   USB_CFG_DESCR_PROPS_UNKNOWN (for all descriptors not handled by the driver)
